# Usage

- Change directory into `/code`
- To generate colorized images for a specific file, run `python3 main.py <image_name> [displacement_factor]`
  - For example: `python3 main.py cathedral` or `python3 main.py church`
  - You can input your own displacement factor, but it is recommended not to (good defaults are in place)
- To generate colorized images for all files, run `python3 main.py ALL`
